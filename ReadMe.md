## Introduction

Augmentinel is re-skinned version of the Geoff Crammond classic: [The
Sentinel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sentinel_(video_game)) (aka The
Sentry).

It emulates the Spectrum version of the game for the original gameplay, then
adds the best features from other ports, plus a few modern extras.

## Features

- Accelerated 3D rendering with mouse free look.
- VR support for OpenVR-compatible headsets.
- Palette and landscape colours from PC version.
- BBC/C64/Spectrum/Amiga tunes and HRTF spatial sound effects.
- Background music from Amiga version.
- Sky view from PC/ST/Amiga versions.
- Unlocked the hex landscapes for a total of 57344.
- Pixel-perfect object selection.
- All remaining game logic runs as normal.

## Building

Building currently requires Visual Studio 2019 or later.

The current code uses the Win32 and D3D11 APIs so it's not yet portable to
non-Windows platforms. It's hoped that will change in the future.
